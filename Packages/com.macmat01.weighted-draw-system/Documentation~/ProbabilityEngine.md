# ProbabilityEngine Documentation

## Overview

The **ProbabilityEngine** is a generic, domain-agnostic system that selects outcomes from a pool of options based on **conditions**, **weights**, and **randomness**. It can power loot systems, NPC behavior, procedural generation, narrative choices, or any system where you need weighted random selection influenced by game state.

This documentation belongs to the Unity package at `Packages/com.macmat01.weighted-draw-system`.
The related Edit Mode tests live under `Tests/EditMode/ProbabilityEngine` and `Tests/EditMode/SchemaImporter`.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Generic & type-safe (works with any data type)
- ✅ Condition-based filtering (options only valid if conditions are met)
- ✅ Weight-based probability (higher weight = more likely)
- ✅ State-aware evaluation (evaluates against your game state)
- ✅ Easy integration with data importers

## How It Works

1. **Filter**: Keep only options whose conditions match your game state
2. **Weight**: Each valid option has a probability weight
3. **Select**: Use weighted random selection to pick one option
4. **Return**: The selected option is returned (you decide what to do with it)

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **ProbabilityEngine<TState, TValue>** ⭐ Main Class
The generic probability engine that drives everything.

```csharp
public class ProbabilityEngine<TState, TValue>
    where TState : IGameState
{
    public List<ProbabilityItem<TState, TValue>> GetValidChoices(TState state)
    public ProbabilityItem<TState, TValue> EvaluateRandom(TState state)
}
```

**What it does:**
- Takes a collection of items and a game state
- Filters items: keeps only those whose conditions are met
- Performs weighted random selection on valid items
- Returns the selected item (with its data/value intact)

**Generic parameters:**
- `TState`: Your game state type (must implement `IGameState`)
- `TValue`: The data type of each option (can be anything: strings, objects, data records, etc.)

**Example usages:**
```csharp
// Selecting a loot drop
var engine = new ProbabilityEngine<GameState, LootDrop>(lootOptions);
var selectedLoot = engine.EvaluateRandom(currentGameState);

// Selecting an NPC response
var engine = new ProbabilityEngine<DialogueState, DialogueLine>(dialogueOptions);
var selectedLine = engine.EvaluateRandom(currentDialogueState);

// Selecting a procedural event
var engine = new ProbabilityEngine<WorldState, Event>(eventOptions);
var selectedEvent = engine.EvaluateRandom(currentWorldState);
```

#### 2. **ProbabilityItem<TState, TValue>** 
Represents a single option in your pool.

```csharp
public class ProbabilityItem<TState, TValue>
{
    public string Id;                              // Unique identifier
    public float BaseWeight;                       // Probability weight (higher = more likely)
    public TValue Value;                           // The actual data (loot, dialogue, etc.)
    public List<ICondition<TState>> Conditions;    // Must ALL be true for this item to be valid
    
    public bool AreConditionsMet(TState state)     // Check if this item can be selected
}
```

**What it represents:**
- A single selectable option with its associated data
- The weight determines how likely it is to be chosen
- Conditions gate whether it can be chosen at all

#### 3. **IGameState**
The interface your game state must implement.

```csharp
public interface IGameState
{
    // Your implementation decides what goes here
}
```

**What it is:**
- A marker interface that your game state must implement
- Allows the engine to work with any state type
- Your state class implements this and provides whatever properties/methods conditions need to evaluate

**Example:**
```csharp
public class MyGameState : IGameState
{
    public int PlayerHealth { get; set; }
    public bool HasSword { get; set; }
    public int Gold { get; set; }
    // ... any other state you need
}
```

#### 4. **ICondition<TState>**
The interface for condition logic.

```csharp
public interface ICondition<in TState> where TState : IGameState
{
    bool Evaluate(TState state);  // Returns true if this condition is satisfied
}
```

**What it does:**
- Evaluates whether an option should be available
- Your conditions implement this to check game state
- ALL conditions on an item must return true for it to be valid

### Game State

The engine is **agnostic about your game state structure**. You define:
- What properties your state has
- How conditions evaluate against that state

**Example game states:**
```csharp
// Loot system state
public class LootState : IGameState
{
    public int PlayerLevel { get; set; }
    public string CurrentBiome { get; set; }
    public bool IsBoss { get; set; }
}

// Narrative system state
public class DialogueState : IGameState
{
    public int PlayerReputation { get; set; }
    public HashSet<string> CompletedQuests { get; set; }
    public bool KnowsSecret { get; set; }
}

// Procedural world state
public class WorldState : IGameState
{
    public int DayCount { get; set; }
    public WeatherType CurrentWeather { get; set; }
    public float Population { get; set; }
}
```

## Extensibility

### Creating Custom Conditions

Since all options must implement `ICondition<TState>`, you create conditions by implementing this interface:

```csharp
public interface ICondition<in TState> where TState : IGameState
{
    bool Evaluate(TState state);
}
```

**Example conditions:**

```csharp
// Check if player has enough health
public class HealthThresholdCondition : ICondition<PlayerState>
{
    public int MinHealth { get; set; }
    
    public bool Evaluate(PlayerState state)
    {
        return state.PlayerHealth >= MinHealth;
    }
}

// Check if player has a specific item
public class HasItemCondition : ICondition<PlayerState>
{
    public string ItemId { get; set; }
    
    public bool Evaluate(PlayerState state)
    {
        return state.Inventory.Contains(ItemId);
    }
}

// Check time-based availability
public class TimeWindowCondition : ICondition<WorldState>
{
    public int StartHour { get; set; }
    public int EndHour { get; set; }
    
    public bool Evaluate(WorldState state)
    {
        int currentHour = state.CurrentTime.Hour;
        return currentHour >= StartHour && currentHour < EndHour;
    }
}

// Check multiple conditions (AND logic)
public class CompositeCondition : ICondition<GameState>
{
    public List<ICondition<GameState>> Conditions { get; set; }
    
    public bool Evaluate(GameState state)
    {
        return Conditions.All(c => c.Evaluate(state));
    }
}

// Check numeric comparison
public class NumericCondition : ICondition<WorldState>
{
    public string StatName { get; set; }
    public float ComparisonValue { get; set; }
    public ComparisonOperator Operator { get; set; }
    
    public bool Evaluate(WorldState state)
    {
        float statValue = state.GetStat(StatName);
        return Operator switch
        {
            ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan => statValue > ComparisonValue,
            ComparisonOperator.LessThan => statValue < ComparisonValue,
            ComparisonOperator.Equal => Mathf.Approximately(statValue, ComparisonValue),
            ComparisonOperator.GreaterOrEqual => statValue >= ComparisonValue,
            ComparisonOperator.LessOrEqual => statValue <= ComparisonValue,
            _ => false
        };
    }
}
```

**How to use in your pool:**

```csharp
var lootPool = new List<ProbabilityItem<LootState, Loot>>
{
    new ProbabilityItem<LootState, Loot>
    {
        Id = "common_drop",
        BaseWeight = 1.0f,
        Value = new Loot { Name = "Rusty Sword" },
        Conditions = null  // No conditions = always valid
    },
    new ProbabilityItem<LootState, Loot>
    {
        Id = "rare_drop",
        BaseWeight = 0.2f,
        Value = new Loot { Name = "Legendary Sword" },
        Conditions = new List<ICondition<LootState>>
        {
            new HealthThresholdCondition { MinHealth = 50 }
        }
    }
};

var engine = new ProbabilityEngine<LootState, Loot>(lootPool);
var selectedLoot = engine.EvaluateRandom(currentState);
```

## Data Structure

### ProbabilityItem<TState, TValue>

The fundamental unit of the system. Represents a single selectable option.

```csharp
public class ProbabilityItem<TState, TValue>
{
    public string Id;                              // Unique identifier
    public float BaseWeight;                       // Base probability weight
    public TValue Value;                           // Any data type (your game data)
    public List<ICondition<TState>> Conditions;    // Optional list of conditions
}
```

**For Designers:**
- **Id**: Give each option a meaningful name (e.g., "dragon_loot_rare")
- **BaseWeight**: Higher numbers = more likely to be picked
  - Weight 1.0 = default probability
  - Weight 2.0 = twice as likely as weight 1.0
  - Weight 0.5 = half as likely as weight 1.0
- **Value**: The actual game data (loot object, dialogue line, NPC response, etc.)
- **Conditions**: List of conditions that must ALL be true for this option to be available

**For Developers:**
- `TValue` can be any type: primitives, custom classes, scriptable objects, data records, etc.
- Null conditions = option is always valid
- Empty conditions list = option is always valid
- Multiple conditions must ALL evaluate to true (AND logic)

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Define Your Game State

Implement `IGameState` with whatever data your conditions need:

```csharp
public class GameState : IGameState
{
    public int Health { get; set; }
    public int Level { get; set; }
    public bool HasWeapon { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, int> Resources { get; set; }
}
```

### Step 2: Create Your Conditions

Implement `ICondition<TState>` for each rule you need:

```csharp
public class IsHighLevel : ICondition<GameState>
{
    public int RequiredLevel { get; set; }
    
    public bool Evaluate(GameState state)
    {
        return state.Level >= RequiredLevel;
    }
}

public class HasWeaponEquipped : ICondition<GameState>
{
    public bool Evaluate(GameState state)
    {
        return state.HasWeapon;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Your Options

Build your pool of `ProbabilityItem<TState, TValue>`:

```csharp
// Example: Loot drop system
var lootOptions = new List<ProbabilityItem<GameState, Loot>>
{
    new ProbabilityItem<GameState, Loot>
    {
        Id = "common_drop",
        BaseWeight = 1.0f,
        Value = new Loot { Name = "Iron Sword", Rarity = "Common" },
        Conditions = null  // Always available
    },
    new ProbabilityItem<GameState, Loot>
    {
        Id = "rare_drop",
        BaseWeight = 0.3f,
        Value = new Loot { Name = "Dragon Blade", Rarity = "Rare" },
        Conditions = new List<ICondition<GameState>>
        {
            new IsHighLevel { RequiredLevel = 10 }
        }
    },
    new ProbabilityItem<GameState, Loot>
    {
        Id = "legendary_drop",
        BaseWeight = 0.05f,
        Value = new Loot { Name = "Excalibur", Rarity = "Legendary" },
        Conditions = new List<ICondition<GameState>>
        {
            new IsHighLevel { RequiredLevel = 20 },
            new HasWeaponEquipped()
        }
    }
};
```

### Step 4: Create the Engine

```csharp
var engine = new ProbabilityEngine<GameState, Loot>(lootOptions);
```

### Step 5: Evaluate When Needed

```csharp
GameState currentState = new GameState 
{ 
    Level = 15, 
    HasWeapon = true, 
    Health = 100 
};

// Get only valid options for current state
List<ProbabilityItem<GameState, Loot>> validDrops = 
    engine.GetValidChoices(currentState);

Console.WriteLine($"Valid drops: {validDrops.Count}");

// Pick one randomly based on weights
ProbabilityItem<GameState, Loot> selectedDrop = 
    engine.EvaluateRandom(currentState);

if (selectedDrop != null)
{
    Loot loot = selectedDrop.Value;
    Console.WriteLine($"You received: {loot.Name}");
}
```

## Example Scenario: Combat Encounter

**Setup:** An RPG where enemy AI decides its action based on game state.

**State:**
```csharp
public class CombatState : IGameState
{
    public int PlayerHealth { get; set; }
    public int EnemyHealth { get; set; }
    public bool PlayerHasShield { get; set; }
}
```

**Conditions:**
```csharp
public class PlayerHealthLow : ICondition<CombatState>
{
    public int Threshold { get; set; }
    public bool Evaluate(CombatState state) => state.PlayerHealth <= Threshold;
}

public class PlayerHasShield : ICondition<CombatState>
{
    public bool Evaluate(CombatState state) => state.PlayerHasShield;
}
```

**Actions (TValue = Action):**
```csharp
enum Action { Attack, Defense, Flee }

var enemyActions = new List<ProbabilityItem<CombatState, Action>>
{
    // Always aggressive if player weak
    new ProbabilityItem<CombatState, Action>
    {
        Id = "aggressive_attack",
        BaseWeight = 2.0f,
        Value = Action.Attack,
        Conditions = new List<ICondition<CombatState>>
        {
            new PlayerHealthLow { Threshold = 30 }
        }
    },
    
    // Defend if player has shield
    new ProbabilityItem<CombatState, Action>
    {
        Id = "defensive_stance",
        BaseWeight = 1.5f,
        Value = Action.Defense,
        Conditions = new List<ICondition<CombatState>>
        {
            new PlayerHasShield()
        }
    },
    
    // Flee as last resort
    new ProbabilityItem<CombatState, Action>
    {
        Id = "flee",
        BaseWeight = 0.1f,
        Value = Action.Flee,
        Conditions = null  // Always available (but very unlikely)
    }
};

var engine = new ProbabilityEngine<CombatState, Action>(enemyActions);
```

**Evaluation:**
```csharp
CombatState state = new CombatState 
{ 
    PlayerHealth = 20,      // Low!
    EnemyHealth = 50,
    PlayerHasShield = false 
};

var selectedAction = engine.EvaluateRandom(state);

// Result: Likely to be Action.Attack because PlayerHealthLow condition is met
// and "aggressive_attack" has weight 2.0
```

## How Weighted Selection Works

The engine uses `WeightedRandom.PickIndex()` to select options based on their weights:

```csharp
public static int PickIndex(List<float> weights)
{
    // Sum all weights
    float total = weights.Sum();
    
    // Pick a random value between 0 and total
    float r = Random.value * total;
    
    // Find which weight range the random value falls into
    for (int i = 0; i < weights.Count; i++)
    {
        if (r < weights[i]) return i;
        r -= weights[i];
    }
    
    return weights.Count - 1;
}
```

**Example:**
```csharp
var weights = new[] { 1.0f, 2.0f, 0.5f };  // Total = 3.5
// Probabilities:
//   Option 0: 1.0 / 3.5 ≈ 29%
//   Option 1: 2.0 / 3.5 ≈ 57%
//   Option 2: 0.5 / 3.5 ≈ 14%
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **No valid options**: `EvaluateRandom()` returns `null`
- **All weights are zero**: Falls back to uniform random selection
- **Negative weights**: Converted to 0

## Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity:**
  - `GetValidChoices()`: O(n × m) where n = item count, m = conditions per item
  - `EvaluateRandom()`: O(n × m + n log n) due to condition evaluation and weighted selection

- **Space Complexity:**
  - Engine instance: O(n) where n = item count
  - Per evaluation: O(n) for valid items list

**Optimization Tips:**
- Cache the engine instance if evaluating the same pool repeatedly
- Keep condition lists short (typically 1-3 conditions per item)
- Avoid expensive state lookups in condition evaluation
- Pre-sort items if you have a clear probability tier system

## RandomiserSystem: Data Integration

The `RandomiserSystem` class bridges imported data with the `ProbabilityEngine`:

```csharp
public sealed class RandomiserSystem
{
    public List<DataRecord> GetValidChoices(IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> gameStateContext)
    public DataRecord EvaluateRandom(IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> gameStateContext)
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Works with imported CSV/JSON data records
- Supports condition columns and weight columns
- Uses a dictionary-based game state for dynamic context
- Automatically builds conditions from parsed condition lists

**Usage:**
```csharp
// Load imported data
var dataRecords = importer.LoadRecords("loot_table.csv");

// Create randomiser system
var randomiser = new RandomiserSystem(
    dataRecords, 
    schema, 
    conditionColumnName: "Conditions",
    weightColumnName: "Weight"
);

// Evaluate with dynamic context
var context = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "playerLevel", 10 },
    { "isBoss", false },
    { "hasLuckPotion", true }
};

var selectedRecord = randomiser.EvaluateRandom(context);
```

## Best Practices

### For Designers:
- ✅ Keep base weights between 0.1 and 10 for easier balancing
- ✅ Use meaningful IDs (e.g., "loot_rare_sword" not "option_5")
- ✅ Test conditions thoroughly—an option with an always-false condition is wasted
- ✅ Group related options into separate engines for clarity
- ❌ Don't create too many condition types—reuse existing ones

### For Developers:
- ✅ Keep game state implementations simple and focused
- ✅ Make conditions stateless (don't modify state during evaluation)
- ✅ Return `null` conditions list if option has no conditions (faster than empty list)
- ✅ Cache engines if used frequently
- ✅ Test edge cases: no valid options, all weights zero, single option
- ❌ Don't put complex logic in condition evaluation—pre-compute if possible
